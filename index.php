		<p class="text-center">Here you will learn how to code in a number of languages! After you get the hang<br>
		of our site, you will be a master coder! You will learn to make things like computer games and applications, <br>
		iOS and Android games, applications, Web Applications, and Web Pages (Like this one).</p>

		<p class="text-center">There are two main ways to learn here: Posts, and Video Courses. <br>
		With Posts users will type out an informational forum post that is basically a typed out tutorial. <br>
		But with Video Courses users can ecord and upload video tutorials for specific topics for an <br>
		alternative and more interactive method to learn.</p>

		<p class="text-center">As this is a community site, almost every course will be made by<br>
		users like you. But there will be some made by us to give the users an idea of how to make them.<br>
		Wether they be made by users or us, all topics will fall into what's called a Branch. Branches are essentially<br>
		paths to take in the specified language(s). Any Branches can go off the original course and lead to more<br>
		specific topics.<br><br>
